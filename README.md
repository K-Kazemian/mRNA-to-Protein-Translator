# mRNA-to-Protein-Translator
A Python program that translates mRNA sequences into protein sequences using the standard genetic code. This tool takes an mRNA sequence as input, processes it in codons (triplets of nucleotides), and outputs the corresponding amino acid sequence in single-letter code. It handles uppercase input, stops at the first stop codon.
